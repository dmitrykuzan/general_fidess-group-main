        <p>
          In no event shall _COMPANY_ or its suppliers be liable for any damages

          _COMPANY_ authorized representative has been notified orally or in
          writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions
          do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
          liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations
          may not apply to you.
